            <h2>Lancaster Front-End Meetup Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p class="lead">Lancaster Front-End Meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the meetup organizers.</p>

            <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion</li>
              <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
              <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
              <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
              <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
              <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
              <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
              <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Enforcement</h2>

            <p>Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Organizers, sponsors, and guests are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, guest speakers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.</p>

            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.</p>

            <p>Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>

            <h2>Reporting</h2>

            <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations have no place at our meetups and reduce the value of our meetups for everyone. We want you to feel safe and happy at our event because people like you make our meetups what they are.</p>

            <p>You can make a report by contacting an event organizer. When taking a report, organizers will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.</p>
            
            <p>Reports can be made by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/lancaster-front-end/members/?op=leaders"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contacting a meetup organizer on Meetup.com</a> or <a href="mailto:eclarkdesign@gmail.com">emailing Eric Clark</a> directly.</p>
            
            <p>A form to submit anonymous reports will be added soon.</p>
